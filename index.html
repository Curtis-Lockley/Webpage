           <div> <p style="vertical-align: top;  font-size: 23px; margin-top:15%;">There are three methods to implementing CSS into a webpage. The three methods are inline, internal and external. As you can see from the poster on, each type of implementation has their pros and cons and it is important to know when to use each method. Inline is when you want to sstyle an individual element. Internal is where all the CSS code is implemented in the same document as the HTML code. Lastly, external is where the HTML document will link itself to an external document that will contain all of the CSS code, if you;re wondering as to which method you should use, I present the pros and cons of each method further down this page.

            <div> <p style="vertical-align: top; font-size: 22px; margin-top:15%;"> The box model determines how elements on a webpage are spaced out from each other. There are four parts to the box model. Margin, border, padding and content. The poster explains these four parts as well as shows a diagram and example of what the box model looks like. It is important to understand the box model when using CSS as it can make or break the layout. The button below will send you to a tutorial on how to implement the box model as well as show more examples on how it can be used. </p>

           <div> <p style="vertical-align: top;  font-size: 22px; margin-top:5%; ">  As well as the functions presented in the poster, Javascript can also make use of the following feautres:
              
               <br>
               <b> FOR Loop:</b>This is code that will loop until a condition is met. For example looping until A is less than 10.
               <br>
               <b>While Loop:</b>A while loop will repeat code as long as the predefined condtion is met. When the condition stops being met, the rest of the code will execute. You can also break the while loop through the use of a break statment.
               <br>
               <b>Do/While Loop:</b>This is similar to a while loop. A do/while loop will carry out the code once, then it will check to see if the condition is still true. Assuming the condition is true, the process will repeat until the condition is no longer met.
               <br>
               <b>Object Orientation:</b>Object orientation is where objects are created from a class that contain the key components of that object. This could be a button for example. This allows for you to make multiple instances of the object throughout the program instead remaking it each time.
               <br>
               <b>Event Handling:</b>When you move your mouse, click on a button or hover over a link,javascript can be programmed to carry out certain code for when these events occur. This is known as event handling. An example could be, you move your mouse over an image and then an animation plays.
               <br>
               <b>Javascript Function:</b>A Javascript function is code contained inside brackets with a keyword and function name. This allows the function to be called upon/used by the rest of the code. For example, a button could call a function that displays a messagebox.

        <div style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 20px;">
            
        <p><b>Inline Advantages:</b> 
            <br>
            The first advantage to useing inline is that it doesn't require you to create a seperate document in order to impleent the styles as you can implement them straight onto the lement itself. This makes it quick and easy to use. Inline is good for testing and debugging a webpage as inline enables you to edit certain parts of your code to find the problem as opposed to changing all the elements. On smaller webpages, inline can make a webpage load quicker as it doesn't need to request the CSS document to apply the styles.
            </p>
        
        <p><b>Inline Disadvantages:</b><br>
           The biggest downside to inline is that you need to apply the style to each element you wish to use the same style on. This makes it more time consuming if you are using a certain style on many different elements. On larger webpages, this can increase the load time as the additional code from all the inline implementaions would add up whereas internal or external would reduce the file size.
            </p>
        
        <p><b>Internal Advantages:</b><br>
          The biggest advantage internal has over inline is that you can apply the style to elements that meet a certain criteria such as being a paragraph or having a certain ID. It also allows you to apply the style to a specific part of a container such as only applying the style to a header and not paragraphs. The file size is reduced from inline as you only need to write the CSS code once.
            </p>
        
        
        <p><b>Internal Disadvantages:</b><br>
   Because there are less requests for HTTP, internal can be slower than both inline and external. The increase in load time could be enough to turn someone away from your webpage before it even loads in. Another factor that makes this worse than external is that the file size is bigger than external due to all the CSS and HTML code being in the same document.
            </p>
        
             
            
        <p><b>External Advantages:</b><br>
      External has the least impact on the file size due to all the CSS code being in a seperate folder. This makes developing the HTML code easier to handle as you don't have all the CSS in the way. Classes within the document can be created that will be applied to the elements as opposed to adding the style in each time like in inline. Another advantage to external is that it can be used carried across to another project to use as a template and keep consistency.
            </p>
        
            
        <p><b>External Disadvantages:</b><br>
          In order to load the CSS, you will need to download it separately from the HTML document. Because of this, the webpage may not function without the CSS or the document may not load in at all. For smaller projects, external CSS implementation may not be the best way to go as other implementations may be more suitable.
            </p>
        
            
        <p><b>Conclusion:</b><br>
        In conclusion, the best implementation method overall is the external implementation. This is becuase you can apply the stylesheet to furture projects as well as giving the developers an easier time managing the page's contents. It's also good from a consumer standpoint as it can reduce the load times of a webpage. Inline would be the second best in my opinion as it's good when used with external implementation or used by itself for smaller projects and testing purposes or if the CSS being used doesn't warrant a style sheet.

        <br>
       <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center;">
    <img class="responsive-img"  src="Assets/Browsers.png"/>
    <br>
</div>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px; font-size: 22px;"><p>Because each browser has different way of executing the code given to it, it's important that your webpage is tested on the three common browsers, chrome, firefox and edge.
        <br>
        An example of something that would return a different result depending on your browser is code designed to detect what browser you're using and stores at as a string to be used later in the webpage.
        <br>
        An alert box will function differently across browsers. For example in Chrome, you can move an alertbox around the screen whereas firefox will remain in the same spot.
        
        Browser detection can also be used to know which version of a browser is being used. This is known as object detection. Object detection is useful as older versions of firefox may not support some of the javascript being used. This allows you to make alternative code when the main code isn't supported, making more browsers compatiable with your webpage. An example of this could be to give an alertbox,informing the user that their browser is out of date.
